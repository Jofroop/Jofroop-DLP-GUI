# Jofroop-DLP-GUI
A GUI for Youtube-DLP.

Very simple with almost no additonal features. The yt-dlp file must be downloaded seperately. Use the folder button to open the yt-dlp.exe file. Then use the output button to set the output path of the video. 

If there are any bugs like the program not saving file paths on restart, please tell me.

To do:
- Add a green checkmark when the yt-dlp path is succesfully selected.
- Remove the "reset seettings" button.
- Add some settings like quality settings with checkboxes.
- Provide a download link to the yt-dlp page.
- Maybe even provide a way to automatically download the latest yt-dlp version.
- Add download queue.
