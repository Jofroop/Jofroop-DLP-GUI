A very simple client. The YT-DLP file must be downloaded seperately. Use the folder button to locate the YT-DLP file, and use the output button to set the output path.

If there are any bugs like the program not saving file paths on restart, please make an issue.

To do:
- Add a green checkmark when the yt-dlp path is succesfully selected.
- Add a confirmation when the file has finished downloading.
- Add some settings like quality settings with checkboxes, or an mp3 option.
- Provide a download link to the yt-dlp page.
- Maybe even provide a way to automatically download the latest yt-dlp version.
- Add download queue.
- Add options for more file types with ffmpeg.
- Dark mode.
