# Jofroop-DLP-GUI
A GUI for Youtube-DLP.

Very simple with almost no additonal features. The yt-dlp file must be downloaded seperately. Use the folder button to open the yt-dlp.exe file. Then use the output button to set the output path of the video. 

If there are any bugs like the program not saving file paths on restart, please tell me.
